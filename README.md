# Pacman

Here's my pacman game for CMPM 170. 

So where to start. This project took my so long to complete. Between finding time to work on it and having issues with working on my mac and switching back and forth with windows, it took me a while to get a solid foundation for the game.

My biggest resources were SFML blogs and tutorials and videos as well as trying to get pointed in the right direction with others code on github. 

I built off of my Pong game's game states as the foundation for rendering and updating the game. The game's main parts are the enemy ghosts, the main character, and the level. Building the level was tedious and hard. Getting the collisions right took my a while and was a big obstacle for me to accomplish. 

Making the enemies as well was very difficult. At first I could only make the enemies randomly navigate throught the level but eventually they started to work correctly after several weeks of working on the AI. 

The audio is in place and the spritesheet was taken from google. I kind of used a template for the mape but made some adjustments with my free time to make it look unique. 

There is a first and second level with the second level having slightly faster enemies. 

Overall this assignment proved very difficult. I underestimated it's difficulty and how much time i would need especially being super busy with work. In the end, I think the game functions as a pacman clone. Time to work on the flappy bird game.
